# ClickNGo 

> **Book Local. Live Better.**

ClickNGo is a full-stack local services booking platform that lets users discover and book trusted services near them — from grooming and healthcare to real estate and sports — all in a few taps.

---

##  Project Objective

The goal of ClickNGo is to bridge the gap between local service providers and customers by offering a seamless, category-driven booking experience. Users can browse services by category, view provider availability in real time, and complete secure bookings — all from a single, intuitive web application.

##  Challenges & Optimizations

### 1.  Connecting Frontend with Backend

**Challenge:** Establishing reliable communication between the React frontend and the Node/Express backend was a major hurdle — especially handling CORS, API base URLs across environments, and synchronizing async state with API responses.

**How I solved it:** Through iterative debugging and learning from each failure, I progressively built a working integration. I studied CORS configuration, set up proper Axios/fetch base URLs, and structured API calls inside React hooks and useEffect blocks. Each error became a learning point that deepened my understanding of how full-stack data flow actually works.

**Optimization applied:**
- Centralized all API calls in a dedicated service layer to keep components clean
- Used environment variables (`.env`) to manage base URLs across development and production
- Added loading and error states in the UI so users always have feedback during API calls

---

### 2.  Designing a Scalable Category Architecture

**Challenge:** Supporting four very different service categories (Grooming, Real Estate, HealthCare, Sports & Gaming), each with their own sub-services and booking flows, without duplicating code.

**Optimization applied:**
- Built a generic, data-driven category page that renders dynamically based on route/category params
- Stored category and sub-category data in a normalized database schema
- Reused shared UI components (cards, grids, modals) across all categories

---

### 3.  Authentication & Session Management

**Challenge:** Implementing secure user authentication while keeping the experience smooth (no unnecessary re-logins, persistent sessions).

**Optimization applied:**
- Used JWT tokens stored securely on the client
- Protected routes on both frontend (React Router guards) and backend (middleware)
- Reflected auth state globally via context so the navbar and profile page stay in sync

---

### 4.  Booking State Tracking

**Challenge:** Accurately tracking booking states (pending, completed, cancelled) and surfacing them to users without stale data.

**Optimization applied:**
- Designed a clear `status` field in the bookings table with PostgreSQL constraints
- Dashboard stats (Total, Completed, Cancelled, Pending Reviews) are computed via efficient SQL queries rather than client-side filtering
